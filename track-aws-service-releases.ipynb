Firewall Manager today supports security groups associated with EC2 instances and Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). With this launch, you can now utilize Firewall Manager’s capabilities to also centrally manage security groups associated with Application Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers. You can audit security groups associated with these resource types to ensure they are only accessing IP CIDRs or ports mandated by your organization. You can use pre-packaged audit rules provided by Firewall Manager, or customize your own audit rules to check for non-compliance. For example, you can audit existing security group rules on Application Load Balancers to ensure they are only accessing the CloudFront IPs you have listed. Similarly, you can also define a Firewall Manager policy to specify security groups with a baseline set of inbound and outbound rules that you want associated with your load balancers. Only requests that comply with the inbound rules can reach your load balancers, and the load balancers will only distribute requests that meet the outbound rules. Furthermore, with Firewall Manager, you can auto-remediate any non-compliant rules and get a detailed list of violations on your Firewall Manager console.\n              <br/>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/aws-firewall-manager-now-supports-security-groups-on-albs-and-elbs/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/amazon-corretto-8-11-support-extended/\">\n              Amazon Corretto 8 &amp; 11 support extended\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Aug 20, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              Amazon is extending long-term support (LTS) for Amazon Corretto 8 from June 2023 to May 2026 and for Amazon Corretto 11 from August 2024 to September 2027.

The first feature is an optional filtering field in the ListShards API that enables you to set filtering criteria for the shards that you want to list from a data stream. For example, you can now use a timestamp filter to list shards with data at a certain time point. The second feature is a new field called ChildShards in the GetRecords and the SubscribeToShards APIs that enables you to discover child shards of a closed shard (without having to use the ListShards API to list all closed and open shards). Applications consuming data from Kinesis Data Streams can use this new field to efficiently transition reading from a closed shard to reading from its child shard. This is a common use case encountered by consuming applications when a shard is closed due to stream scaling operations.\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/amazon-kinesis-data-streams-two-new-api-features-simplify-consuming-data-from-kinesis-streams/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/aws-datasync-simplifies-automation-with-api-filters/\">\n              AWS DataSync simplifies automation with API filters\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Aug 18, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              <a href=\"/datasync/\" target=\"_blank\">\n               AWS DataSync\n              </a>\n              now supports filtering for the ListTasks and ListLocations API calls, enabling you to easily retrieve configuration of data transfer tasks, using filters such as the source or destination for the data transfer.

Modern day web applications are typically built with a chain of proxies that ensure fast and reliable communication between clients and servers. While these proxies follow a standard mechanism to parse RFC 7230 compliant HTTP/1.1 requests, they may have differences in interpretation while parsing non-compliant requests. These differences in interpretation can cause Desync where different proxies in the chain may disagree on request boundaries and therefore may not process the same request. This could leave behind arbitrary messages that may be prepended to the next request in the queue and smuggled to the backend. Ultimately, request smuggling can make applications vulnerable to request queue or cache poisoning, which could lead to credential hijacking or execution of unauthorized commands.\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/application-and-classic-load-balancers-adding-defense-in-depth-with-introduction-of-desync-mitigation-mode/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/amazon-eks-managed-node-groups-now-support-ec2-launch-templates-custom-amis/\">\n              Amazon EKS managed node groups now support EC2 launch templates and custom AMIs\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Aug 17, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) now supports using\n              <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/LaunchTemplates.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n               launch templates\n              </a>\n              to customize EC2 instance settings for nodes managed by EKS.

Personal folders allow admins and authors to organize and manage content within their user accounts. Authors and admins can create personal folders and add dashboards, analyses and data sets in them. Personal folders are private to each author/admin and do not affect permissions of assets stored within. Shared folders allow admins and authors to simplify sharing and permissions management over 1000s of dashboards, analyses and data sets, while providing readers with a hierarchical discovery model for information within the team/organization. Shared folders must first be created by QuickSight Admins, who can then grant access to authors and readers. Assets placed in a shared folder will be shared with users at the permission level (owner or viewer) that users have to the folder. Personal and Shared folders are accessible to users from QuickSight's new home page. This new home page has direct links to favorites and recently accessed items, folders and provides sections specific to dashboards, analyses and data sets, with choice of a new responsive thumbnail view or a list view.

With this new integration, you can run workloads such as DNS, IoT, real-time media, and syslog using UDP protocol, allowing high throughput at ultra low latency through the Network Load Balancer.\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/amazon-eks-now-supports-udp-load-balancing-with-network-load-balancer/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/amazon-cloudwatch-synthetics-available-hong-kong-bahrain-cape-town-milan-regions/\">\n              Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics now available in Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Middle East (Bahrain), Africa (Cape Town) and Europe (Milan) Regions\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Aug 13, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              CloudWatch Synthetics allows you to monitor your REST APIs, URLs, and website content every minute, 24x7, and alerts you when your application endpoints don’t behave as expected.

You can also restrict access to network locations, including the public internet.\n              <br/>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/aws-lambda-provides-iam-condition-keys-vpc-settings/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/amazon-cloudfront-announces-new-regional-edge-cache-in-aws-europe-ireland-region/\">\n              Amazon CloudFront announces a new Regional Edge Cache in AWS’ Europe (Ireland) Region\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Aug 10, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              Amazon CloudFront announces a new Regional Edge Cache located in AWS’ Europe (Ireland)\n              <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/\" target=\"_blank\">\n               Region\n              </a>\n              .

You can receive up to a maximum of 1000 results in a single page. If there are more than 1000 results to display, you will receive a Next Token. Use the Next Token to receive the next set of results until the Next Token is null. This enables you to get all the results from your list request in multiple pages. We recommend you to use paginated lists instead of getting all the results in a single request.

You can receive up to a maximum of 1000 results in a single page. If there are more than 1000 results to display, you will receive a Next Token. Use the Next Token to receive the next set of results until the Next Token is null. This enables you to get all the results from your list request in multiple pages. We recommend you to use paginated lists instead of getting all the results in a single request.

FIFO queues are designed to ensure that the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved and that each message is processed exactly once. Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function improves scalability and reliability. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available.\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/amazon-sqs-fifo-queues-now-available-milano/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/amazon-documentdb-with-mongodb-compatibility-adds-new-capabilities/\">\n              Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) adds $regex indexing and support for null characters in strings\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Jun 22, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              <a href=\"/documentdb/\" target=\"_blank\">\n               Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)\n              </a>\n              is a fast, scalable, highly available, and fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads.

These security controls detect when AWS accounts and deployed resources do not align with security best practices defined by AWS security experts. This curated set of controls helps improve a customer’s security posture in AWS and covers AWS’s most popular and foundational services.

The UpdateFindings API only supported a few fields in the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF), and wasn't integrated with CloudWatch Events. The BatchUpdateFindings API fixes those issues and supports a much larger set of fields that can now be updated, such as severity, criticality, confidence, user defined fields, notes, and workflow status. Also, the fields that BatchUpdateFindings can update cannot be updated by finding providers. Those fields can only be updated by the customer or by SIEM/ticketing/SOAR tools that have access to this API action. This prevents finding providers from overwriting your updates. You can use the BatchUpdateFindings API to complete actions such as creating your own suppression rules, changing severity scores, and adding notes to findings.

For migrations tracked using the Migration Hub, an AWS system tag is automatically applied to each migrated EC2 instance or AMI. AWS resources are tagged with the key aws:migrationhub:source-id and the tag value is the discovery server ID corresponding to the originating server.

If the queue was busy, the job would wait to start until previous jobs completed. This presents a challenge for videos requiring strict turnaround times. To solve this, MediaConvert now has the ability to submit jobs using a feature called queue hopping. You specify the queue a job should start in and how long it should wait before hopping to a different queue. With queue hopping, you can avoid long wait times for transcoding jobs that are time-sensitive while also effectively utilizing your reserved transcoding slots. For example, a job can be submitted to a reserved queue with a wait time of 15 minutes; if the job has not started after that time, it can hop to an on-demand queue to start encoding. For more information about queue hopping, please read the\n              <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/setting-up-queue-hopping-to-avoid-long-waits.html\">\n               documentation\n              </a>\n              .\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/support-for-queue-hopping-now-available-with-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/aws-elemental-mediapackage-adds-manifest-filtering/\">\n              Support for Manifest Filtering and Other Improvements Now Available with AWS Elemental MediaPackage\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Apr 8, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              With\n              <a href=\"/mediapackage/\">\n               AWS Elemental MediaPackage\n              </a>\n              , you can now use Manifest Filtering to customize video streams presented to specific devices based on their capabilities, or presented to specific end-user groups based on their subscriber status or language preferences.

When users call or message the provided phone number, they are connected to the other party and their private phone numbers are replaced with the shared number in Caller ID. Personal phone numbers are not displayed, a method often called number masking. With proxy phone sessions, a food delivery service can allow a delivery driver and customer to contact each other for the duration of the delivery period to get information like a gate code or other special instructions. Proxy phone sessions help protect user privacy and keep transactions on your service. Numbers are available on-demand, so developers don't have to calculate how many numbers they will need for different locations, or pay for extra numbers they do not use.\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/introducing-amazon-chime-proxy-phone-sessions/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/vpc-input-and-output-support-now-available-with-aws-elemental-mediaconnect/\">\n              VPC Input and Output Support now available with AWS Elemental MediaConnect\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Apr 7, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              Support for transporting live video over a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is now available with\n              <a href=\"/mediaconnect/\">\n               AWS Elemental MediaConnect\n              </a>\n              .

Using this information, you can better understand the top drivers of your application’s traffic and respond appropriately to unsuccessful requests.\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/amazon-cloudwatch-contributor-insights-for-amazon-dynamodb-is-now-available-in-the-aws-govcloud-us-regions/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/aws-marketplace-available-sellers-consulting-partners-australia-new-zealand/\">\n              Sellers, consulting partners, and data providers from Australia and New Zealand now available in AWS Marketplace and AWS Data Exchange\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Apr 2, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              AWS Marketplace now enables customers to discover and subscribe to software from Australia and New Zealand ISVs and Consulting Partners, adding to the 7,000+ software listings and data products from 1,500+ sellers.

This capability works across accounts, Regions, and organizations in AWS Organizations.\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/introducing-aws-config-multi-account-multi-region-support-for-advanced-query/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/03/announcing-time-expression-for-amazon-comprehend-medical/\">\n              Announcing Time Expression for Amazon Comprehend Medical\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Mar 2, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              Tracking patients health status is imperative for a healthcare provider.

You can now use more information about your items, for example, category, brand, price, duration, size, author, year of release etc., to increase the relevance of recommendations.\n              <br/>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/amazon-personalize-use-10x-more-item-attributes-improve-relevance-recommendations/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/aws-appsync-releases-integration-with-aws-x-ray-and-graphql-info-object-support/\">\n              AWS AppSync releases integration with AWS X-Ray and GraphQL Info object support\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Feb 7, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              You can now enable AWS X-Ray for your APIs in AWS AppSync, making it easier to trace and analyze user requests as they travel through the APIs to the backend data sources.\n              <br/>\n             </p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"reg-cta\">\n             <b>\n              <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/aws-appsync-releases-integration-with-aws-x-ray-and-graphql-info-object-support/\">\n               Read More »\n              </a>\n             </b>\n            </div>\n           </li>\n           <li class=\"directory-item text whats-new\">\n            <h3>\n             <a href=\"//aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/02/new-quick-start-deploys-poly-integrated-amazon-connect-ccp-on-aws/\">\n              New Quick Start deploys Poly-integrated Amazon Connect CCP on AWS\n             </a>\n            </h3>\n            <div class=\"date\">\n             Posted On: Feb 7, 2020\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"description\">\n             <p>\n              This Quick Start automatically deploys the Poly-integrated Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP) in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 30 minutes.
